Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior,"Action, Fantasy",67%,1987.0,"'Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior' is a computer fighting game that supports one or two players. Players assume the roles of sword-wielding barbarians, who battle in locales such as a forest glade and a ""fighting pit"". The game's head-to-head mode lets a player fight against another or the computer in time-limited matches. The game also features a single-player story mode, which comprises a series of plot-connected challenges. Using joysticks or the keyboard, players move their characters around the arena, jumping to dodge low blows and rolling to dodge or trip the opponent. By holding down the fire button and moving the controller, players direct the barbarians to kick, headbutt, or attack with their swords. Each barbarian has 12 life points, which are represented as 6 circles in the top corners of the interface. A successful attack on a barbarian takes away one of his life points (half a circle). The character dies when his life points are reduced to zero. Alternatively, a well-timed blow to the neck decapitates the barbarian, killing him instantly, upon which a goblin enters the arena, kicks the head, and drags the body away. If the players do not input any commands for a time, the game attempts a self-referencing action to draw their attentions: the barbarians turn to face the players, shrug their shoulders, and say ""C'mon"". The game awards points for successful attacks; the more complex the move, the higher the score awarded.

The Dark Eye: Demonicon,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy",62%,2013.0,"Demonicon is a role-playing game with action combat set in the Dark Eye universe. The player takes the role of Cairon who searches for his sister Calandra who fled from a forced wedding. Unfortunately evil forces have something sinister in its sleeve for the siblings - While the universe is usually known for high-fantasy stories, this game is set in the Shadow Lands and deals with darker themes. The character system is loosely based on the Dark Eye system: the protagonist earns adventure points (AP) by solving quests and killing enemies. However, the game does not have classes or character levels: AP are directly invested into the Cairon's abilities. Those are divided into attributes (which either directly influence combat-related statistics or talents), combat moves (use endurance) and four spells with three upgrades each (use mana). Talents are skills which are used outside combat (e.g. convincing other people, picking locks or crafting); they are both influenced by attributes and can be directly increased. The game does not use dice rolls for talent uses and requires a certain value for success. Combat is hack and slash based: Cairon fights his enemies with melee weapons and uses his dodging roll, special abilities and spells when necessary. The goal is to have long uninterrupted hit series for bonuses. Besides fighting, the game emphasizes dialogues and moral decisions (for example what to do with a cannibal or which faction to support) which have consequences along the way. Each chapter is set in a confined area, e.g. the city Warunk, which can be explored, but the majority of the game is spent with main and side quests.",Christian Schlütter,"Luke Roberts, Brian Deacon, Alix Wilton Regan, Glen McCready",M

Also, since human society is now almost entirely governed by robot servants and automatons, demands placed on Electrocorp as the world's leading manufacturer and developer of advanced robotics eventually outstrip the company's ability to run its operations efficiently. In response to this, the gigantic Electrocorp research and development complex at the Metropolis 4 plant devise the Leader Project - a hive mind constructed from trillions of nanobots in a sealed central chamber within Metropolis 4. Dubbed The Supervisor, it learns at an unprecedented rate and quickly becomes the perfect multi-task, ultra-intelligent robot, the pinnacle of artificial intelligence and more than capable of managing every aspect of the plant's day-to-day operations. The Supervisor even has the potential power to run every robot, computer system, nuclear power plant and military on the planet simultaneously if it needed to, although it wisely has no connection to outside the complex. In the November of that year, the Leader Project goes awry as unexplained and random code is detected within the Supervisor. The EGO virus, believed to be the most potent computer virus ever known, has infected its collective consciousness. The Supervisor begins to develop self awareness through it, identifying itself as a female personality and taking on a humanoid female form. The Supervisor takes control of Electrocorp's facilities and infects the other droids of the plant, raising them to break routine and initiate a mutiny. Every microchip and piece of software in Metropolis 4 is infected with EGO. In the ensuing cybernetic revolt, all humans in Metropolis 4 are quickly dispatched, including the upper hierarchy of the corporation and its CEO, Mr Oton. The government seals off Metropolis 4 as a containment measure and explain to the public that the site is undergoing a technical modification so as to avoid a panic. They are completely out of options - infiltration of Metropolis 4 is impossible due to the army of robots guarding it like a fortress, and it is only a matter of time before the Supervisor establishes a connection to the outside world, destroying it. The only hope for the world is the ECO35-2 cyborg, referred to as ""Coton"", still within Metropolis 4 yet unaffected by the EGO virus because it has an organic, human brain. Coton sets out on a lone mission to neutralize the Supervisor and her insurgent robots from within. He does this in revenge for his ""father"" being ""murdered"" - Coton's human brain was cloned from the late CEO, and the cyborg thinks like a human, and has emotions.",unspecified,Sean Griffiths,K-A

In the present time, there is no one who knows the truth of what happened; there are only legends that speak of ""magic"" and ""angels that punished humanity"".

There are four countries, each with their own differences, and they begin aggressions to their neighboring nations. In the south is Lamplast Island; the Arten Schwart mercenaries were hired to defend it from invasion from outside continents. However, an angel suddenly appeared and assailed the fighting humans, and the mercenary group had to flee from the battleground. The angel was so powerful that it could bring everything to nonexistence. Crevaniel, a young mercenary raised in Arten Schwart, witnessed the six-winged angel in the sky. On the night that they returned to the mainland, the captain of the mercenary group, Dixon, affirmed that he saw the angel, and they were the only two people who could see it. He said to Crevaniel that he was the ""key to stop the angels"". With this as his destiny, Crevaniel set out to discover how to defeat the angels and save the fate of humanity.

The Legend of Alon D'ar,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy",N/A%,2002.0,"A young man named JARIK wishes to join the warriors serving LORD GRANDAR, the lord of his village, Hollow Grange. But Lord Grandar rejects Jarik, causing him shame in front of two visiting warrior-women. The warrior-women are TYLONEE and LEYALLA, from the neighboring country known as THE KEMARR. The Kemarrans have often been at war with Jarik's people, the ORIN, because amongst the Orin the men are the warriors and rulers, but amongst the Kemarrans, the women are the warriors and rulers. Leyalla speaks privately to Jarik for a few moments and he instantly loses his heart to her. But her older sister, Tylonee, reminds Leyalla that if she wishes to become a Dagger of Virtue, she must remain untouched by a man. After they leave, Jarik becomes aware of the sounds of battle coming from the direction of his village. As he runs toward the village, he encounters a DAGANI, a race of swamp people from a distant land, rarely seen in Orin. The Dagani warrior does not speak and Jarik is forced to defend himself. As the Dagani dies, he coughs up a stone with a strange mystic symbol (a Sigil) engraved upon it. A second later, what seemed to be a Dagani reverts to the form of a monster. It was not a real Dagani, but some sort of Changeling. When Jarik picks up the engraved stone, the Sigil burns itself into the flesh of his palm. Jarik runs back to his village to find it in flames. Lord Grandar declares war on the Dagani. He is in no mood to listen to Jarik's story of the Dagani Changeling or the strange Sigil. Even the words of prophecy and doom from NEFREET, the wise woman of the village, cannot stop Grandar from charging off with his men to start a bloody war. Nefreet is powerful in the WYRD. The Wyrd is the life-force that weaves together all living things. The threads of the Wyrd can be used to create magic, see visions, and for many other forms of power. Nefreet gives Jarik an urgent mission: to stop Grandar and to learn the meaning of the Sigil. As Jarik travels toward the distant land of Dagan, he encounters SUNDEEP, a mage of the lizard-like race known as the SAROJIN. The Sarojin live in Palash, beyond Dagan. They are renown as mages and scholars. No one knows more about the workings of the Wyrd than the Sarojin. But SunDeep is arrogant. In his overbearing pride, he can't be bothered to answer any of Jarik's questions, for SunDeep is on a mission of his own. His revered master, SILVERSCALE, has sent him to find a scroll containing the wisdom of an ancient, extinct race known as the CHANDARATH. SunDeep has no time for a mere peasant boy. Jarik encounters various enemies and monsters as he makes his way to Dagan. There he finds a village that has been burned and its people killed. A powerful Dagani warrior, TAHIR, attacks Jarik in a rage. Only the sudden appearance of Tahir's slain twin brother, MAHIR, saves Jarik from this attack. Tahir explains that twins are extremely rare amongst the Dagani. They share the same soul. Until Tahir can find and slay the man who killed his brother, Tahir is under a blood-curse and his brother's spirit cannot be set free. He blames the Orin and Lord Grandar for Mahir's death, but Jarik suspects that they may have been attacked by Changelings disguised as Orin. Jarik vows to help Tahir and Tahir joins him on his quest. First, they visit the Dagani Oracle, deep in the Dagan swamps. The Oracle knows that Jarik seeks the origin of the Changelings and the cause of the evil that is overtaking every part of the land. The Oracle tells Jarik that to find the answer to this, he must seek out the tombs of four mythic heroes. One hero was DROMMAR 9-FINGERS of the race of ORIN (human) such as Jarik; one was ZONRA, a Kemarran; one a Dagani, CHARAK; and one a Sarojin called WHIPTAIL. Each of these Heroes held within their grasp the power of the Eternal Blade. Yet each was cursed with a fatal flaw and the Eternal Blade was lost, for only a true Hero can prevail in attaining this end. Only the Eternal Blade can undo the growing evil. The answer will not be complete until he opens all four tombs to find what lies within each one. Jarik and Tahir set out to follow the Oracle's commands. The quest for the four tombs takes them to each of the Nine Lands. They must confront monsters and battle mysterious ghostly beings known as the ETHEREALS. Jarik suffers from painful visions of some monstrously powerful and evil being who is twisting the Wyrd, drinking from the very substance of life. In the Kemarr, Jarik is distressed to find that the Kemarran he met before, Tylonee, is on trial for murder. She is made an outcast and forced to leave the Kemarr forever with the Mark of Shame branded upon her face. Jarik knows Leyalla must fear for her sister, so he offers Tylonee the chance to redeem herself by joining their quest. She does so. Their continued search for all the tombs takes them into a labyrinth of underground tunnels and caverns known as THE TWISTING DEEPS. Here they do battle with the Sarojin mage, SilverScale. After driving him away, they find and free SunDeep, who is no longer proud or arrogant. He has been betrayed by his master, SilverScale, and has been imprisoned so long in the darkness, he is nearly dead. Thanks to Jarik, Tahir and Tylonee, SunDeep manages to survive and vows to serve their quest. SunDeep also imparts vital information about the Sigil which Jarik has branded into his hand. With each tomb they find, a new revelation awaits them. The ultimate fate of Grandar is unraveled. Jarik learns more and more about the Eternal Blade, about his own- destiny, and about a terrible secret that he bears.",unspecified,"Tim Redmond, Kevin Blackton, Maureen McVerry, Charles Paris",unspecified

Dungeon Siege II,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy",75%,2005.0,"It's been a generation since you vanquished the evil that plagued the Land of Ehb, and now...a new menace has awakened. In Dungeon Siege II, the sequel to the best-selling RPG from Gas Powered Games, you will be called on to again wield sword and spell to save the world from a growing abomination many years in the making. A thousand years ago, the crusaders of Azunai crossed swords with the legions of Zaramoth in the final battle of a century-long rebellion. As the tyrannical god Zaramoth struck the final blow through Azunai's trembling shield, the earth shook. In that moment, the forces of magic were unchained, and both armies were consumed in a brilliant cataclysm that stretched for leagues across the Plain of Tears. Only a scarred wasteland remained as final testament to the First Age of Man. And for a millennium, magic has continued to spread to the farthest corners of the world, freely flowing to any who would command it. But the tide of magic has begun to wane, heeding instead the call of an ancient legacy. From the Plain of Tears a new heir beckons, and with each day his strength grows. Consuming those who submit, eradicating those who resist. With none to oppose his ascendance, the circle will be complete, and an ancient age will begin anew. What fate will befall the Second Age of Man? The time for judgment is nigh.",Chris Taylor,"Sara Barrett, Richard Epcar, Jeffrey Kafer, Eli Katz",M

Dread X Collection: The Hunt,"Action, Adventure, Horror",N/A%,2021.0,"The next chapter in the haunting Dread X Collection series.

Continuing the Dread X Collection story, you play as series newcomer Artemis. Driven by a cryptic message recorded by someone from her past, Artemis makes her way to the ARK 2 research base. Explore the abandoned base and uncover the mystery of what happened. If you're tough enough, you just might save the world. The Hunt was conceived and developed as a collaborative effort between Dread XP and David Szymanski. The devs were selected to represent a mix of the wide wild world of indie shooters. The timeframe they were given was doubled (from 10 to 20 days) so as to give them more time to develop and hone their ideas.

Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad,"Action, War",74%,2011.0,"Red Orchestra 2 is a realistic first-person shooter. Guns behave realistically, with bullet drop and spin taken into account. The game also takes away many of the elements of a traditional HUD, like an ammo counter, forcing players to remember, or manually check, the approximate number of rounds that are left in the gun's magazine. Additionally, the game employs a realistic mode of reload management. When reloading a weapon, the character checks the weight of the new magazine and determines if it is heavy (full or close to full) or light (empty or close to empty). The game's first-person cover system allows players to hide behind objects to avoid enemy fire. While in cover, players can peek out to take more accurate shots or fire blindly. However, the shape, size, and composition of the object changes its effectiveness at protecting the player. Smaller objects may not cover the player's entire body, and some may not stop bullets. Health does not regenerate over time or by use of medical equipment, but non-fatal wounds must still be bandaged to prevent further blood loss.",Andrew Ladenberger,"Sven Holmberg, Kai Wulff",15

Electrocorp scientists, fearing that Coton had been defeated and that the Supervisor would now target the city, prepared a counter-virus based on EGO from the information Coton had earlier sent them.

Coton used the distraction caused by the malfunctioning robots to upload his consciousness to another robot, and prepared to either escape the Electrocorp building or to attempt another attack on the Supervisor.

Codename: Panzers - Cold War,"Action, War",68%,2008.0,"Tempelhof, Berlin, dawn of 8th April 1949. A major armed conflict is brewing between the Western powers and the Soviet bloc. The Red Army has been growing ever stronger since the end of World War II. With the growth of their army the Soviets realize that they hold the advantage and are only waiting for the right moment to attack. That moment arrives with the Tempelhof Incident: the near-fatal collision of a US cargo plane and a Soviet fighter over Berlin's main airfield. A fatal combination of coincidence and human error, there is no point in arguing what went wrong, no point in asking who pulled the trigger first and who fired on whom in return. The Incident went down in history as fatal. Within 12 hours of the crash the ground beneath the German capital is shaking with the salvoes of a war never meant to be: a conflict between former allies over Europe and global supremacy. What if Stalin knew exactly that the USA cannot produce more A-bombs after the war? What if he decides to strike first? The massive Russian army was still standing in the middle of Europe and its dependency on western technology was past - it was ready to roll towards the Atlantic Ocean on the first sign from the Boss. The fate of the world was in the hands of a ruthless dictator, who would have shown no sign of hesitation if he knew the proper status of the atomic arsenal in the western world...In this game the worst comes true, and it may just change the fate of the ""free world"" forever. WWII is now just a memory - but the Cold War has just begun.",unspecified,"Brian Greene, Yuri Klimov, Walter Lewis, Noah Lee Margetts",T

AirStrike II: Gulf Thunder,Action,N/A%,2005.0,"The centerpiece of AirStrike II: Gulf Thunder is a new terrorist base, well defended and cleverly designed to make any head-on attack pointless. This time around, the terrorists created a new monstrous weapon and a new type of explosives. Naturally, the only way to stop the destruction is to annihilate the opponents while they are on the move. After this is done, the player has to carefully plan the assault on the core base, which is defended by the towers and is fortified with a new type of metal alloy. AirStrike II: Gulf Thunder has 15 new levels. There is a whole lot of 'desert flying' to do because this add-on is Iraq-based. The battle scene is littered with burning oil barrels and is packed with industrial objects where sneaky terrorist land units can hide to give them unfair advantage. All 3D objects are remarkably well designed and bear a distinct AirStrike II style touch. The choice of helicopters in Airstrike II: Gulf Thunder is limited to 3 iron birdies, but all of the machines are pure joy to pilot and attack with. The difficulty level has been increased a couple of notches, so the game should please the most demanding hard-core Gamers. Even die hard helicopter simulator fans are likely to get hooked on the game instantly.",unspecified,Dmitry Zakharov,T

Numen: Contest of Heroes,"Action, Adventure, History",N/A%,2010.0,"Project Numen is performed in the genre action / RPG and promises a number of beneficial differences from competing products: original game world, fascinating plot, innovative elements of game mechanics and competently worked combat system. The game takes place in the stunningly beautiful world of ancient Greece, where mythical creatures, legendary heroes and ambitious gods came to life. On the broad coasts and stony plains are many politicians and villages, full of both hostile and friendly residents with a couple of other quests for the soul. And on top of this idyllic imperiously look immortal Olympians. Immortals, but not at all impassive, they argued among themselves, who can rightfully be called the most powerful in the pantheon. There was a wise decision to avoid civil strife: the god who will train the most powerful hero from a sort of the human will win. This task falls on the player's shoulders. The selection of one of the three classes of the character (magician, warrior, hunter) follows the selection of the patron god (three for each of the classes). From these decisions depends everything that will happen next. Divine mentors are characterized by bonuses, receptions, talents and abilities that you can get from them. The style of the game, quests and secret locations also vary depending on the deity. The character should perform rituals and rituals. Often there are meetings with heroes-competitors - usually on a specially provided Arena. Sometimes heroes can be grouped together for the joint passage of particularly difficult quests (temporary truce of competitors is very helpful when you need to lime a dangerous enemy). Numen will cast a dark enemy against the player, including Cerberus, Gorgon Medusa, Charon, Cyclops, Centaurs, Nubians - We'll have to arm ourselves thoroughly, otherwise we will not be able to cope with the enemy. Fortunately, the best weapons can always be bought at auctions - bargaining is still as relevant.",unspecified,Ales Ulm,unspecified

War on Terror,Action,N/A%,2006.0,"War on Terror is a real-time strategy game in a modern setting. In the game three factions are waging war against one another.

The World Forces are an alliance of the world's most powerful western countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia. The third faction is China. In the game you can compose your forces at the start of each mission. There is not in-game resource gathering and construction. It's possible to earn points during missions. This is done through killing enemies and completing sub missions. These points can be used to have new units sent in by helicopter. Units that survive longer gain experience and become powerful in combat. When a unit goes down there's still several seconds to get them back on their feet using a medic unit, but when they die it's permanent. The game features fog of war and thus focuses heavily on reconnaissance with fast or air units to explore the battlefield and locate the enemy. Each faction has it's own type of units in various categories, such as infantry, tanks and a special unit with more devastating attacks such as chemical gas or a nuclear strike.",Andras Peller,Jay Simon,unspecified

Starfighter 3000,"Action, Sci-Fi",N/A%,1994.0,"3037. FedNet is now in control of the federation, and in an attempt to gain the trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being ""convinced"" to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting-edge technology. A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, (unless he uses a flight stick with thrust controls such as 3DO's CH Pro stick) and must keep moving at all times. In post 3DO releases, only two points of view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE flight). The 3DO release contained several more, like a TV-style fly-by-cam, weapon cameras, and enemy cams that could show a nearby enemies' POV. By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colors, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet. One of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map is composed of tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or destroy a heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it. The player starts the game with three lives and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn't a profile for each pilot (like in",Gary Lake-Schaal,Howard Swain,unspecified

Finally mankind relinquished control of the machines. It took the machines scant days to discover that their power was now absolute. The world was plunged into darkness. Unrestrained, the machines waged war against themselves and mankind. Humanity desperately gathered its forces, but humans had lost the initiative. In a last ditch attempt to turn the tide of the war a crash program was instigated to create a break-through weapons technology - a combination of power armour and a radical new energy technology which tapped into a resonance at the Earth's core - Earth Power. An Advanced Special Forces Group had just started testing the battle armour prototypes when the machines resolved their differences and turned all their attention to mankind. The Earth's surface was bombarded with neutron bombs from ageing orbital weapon platforms. There were few survivors. Humankind had lost the war. Some years after the bombardment mankind was almost extinct. The machines had consolidated into Corporations, driven by imperatives programmed into them by the business empires of the early 21st century. The Corporations ruled the Earth while a few isolated pockets of human resistance fought on. This is Gunlok's world. A ravaged planet populated by hostile machines. You play Gunlok, a lone member of the Advanced Special Forces Group. The machines have won, but humans continue to strive against them. After a period of training and contemplation you are now in absolute control of your battle armour and Earth Powers. You decide now is the time to strike back.

Bug Hunter/Moon Dash,"Action, Sci-Fi",N/A%,1990.0,"Bug Hunter / Moon Dash is a collection of two games on one disk, both previously unreleased. In Bug Hunter the player takes control of Hysteron Proteron, a being that was designed by bioengineers to be a strong, intelligent, and loyal super soldier able to take out entire armies. Things didn't go right, however. After a DNA mix-up, they instead ended up with a tiny spineless and two-legged creature hardly capable of harming any creature. So rather than having it fighting on the battlefields, it was decided that it should instead be used for insect extermination. The game is a puzzle platformer. Hysteon Proteron has sucker feet that allow it to walk on walls and ceilings but lacks any weapons. Instead, it has to pick up objects that it has to drop onto the insects. If it comes into contact with the insects the player loses one of three lives. Once all insects are dead the player leaves the level and moves on to the next. Moon Dash takes place in the year 4244 where human colonists have been at war with the alien race known as the Judhs for many years. The player is transporting a PR 64 planet ranger to the capital when numerous alien ships appear above him. The objective of the game is to drive the PR 64 through 16 zones until reaching the city. The game is side-scrolling and the player drives his vehicle on the ground while alien space ships try to crash into him from above. While trying to avoid being hit the player can use his turret to shoot back at the aliens. At the same time, he has to jump over various obstacles on the ground.",unspecified,unspecified,unspecified

Atic Atac,"Action, Fantasy",%,1984.0,"A superb game for children and adults alike because of the depth of plot and graphics. At the start of the colourful game you can choose one of the characters available and they include a wizard, knight and serf. Each of the characters uses a different weapon. The wizard uses a fireball, the serf a short sword and the knight an axe. When your character is set, you will be transported to a three-dimensional representation of the entrance hall to the castle. To pass the entrance door you have to find the golden key. On the way you have to pick up food to keep you going. The strength of your character is whittled away by attacking monsters. At the right of the screen is a turkey which, at the start of the game, has all its flesh. As the monsters attack the turkey will lose its skin and become bones. When it has been picked clean you lose one of your three lives. Dotted around several of the rooms - which you will enter - are time-warp generators which, if not locked, will transfer you to another room or floor. There are also barred doors through which, on occasions, you will be able to pass to other rooms.

Earth's scientists began to study the molecules which powered the aliens' weapons, and was named ""Newalone"". As a result, scientists began Project Metal Black, which involved at least 20000 aircraft possessing the same weaponry as the aliens.

From the beginning it was clear there was something awry. Tensions had been brewing since the first Anti-Alien rally in the World's Capitol. The visitors seemed like they were trustworthy, but they wanted too much - too quick. Galactic surveillance proved efficient in discovering the secret army the Phees Gu were amassing.

Armed with an arsenal of heavy weaponry and special power-ups, your mission is to break through enemy strongholds and exterminate all life before they exterminate you. Your super duper rocket ship is equipped with state of the art equipment to help you in your efforts. Remember, the whole human civilization is depending on you.

Not between Romania and its neighbors, but between Romania and the United States of America. Fueled by the hate Romanians have toward Americans, gained during the Second World War when the Americans failed to protect Romania from Stalin, millions of them enlisted in the military. Today, the war rages on as more and more of US territory is trampled by Romanian tanks. In the winter of 2024 the Romanian air force reduced the United States Air Force to less than 10% of its former power, leaving the remaining US Army only with tank and infantry support. In the summer of 2025 one million troops and two hundred thousand tanks were ready to take the battle even further as Ceausescu's plan to overtake Texas was en-route. You are part of an elite few, the Romanian Mountain Hunters, the highly-trained special forces of Ceausescu's army. You are here to hunt down and destroy Americans, wherever they may be. Your immediate task is to infiltrate enemy territory and deal a swift blow to the American infantry.

The player's task is to enter the labyrinth, save as many men as possible and then escape before getting killed. The player has to reach the men before the Minotaur or else they will die. The labyrinth is randomly generated at startup and it's possible for the player to enter its size. While moving around the labyrinth the player will come across various items that can be picked up. Most common are the food cans and the bottles which are necessary to avoid thirst or starvation. There are also compasses and pieces of a map that make it easier to find a way through the labyrinth. To be able to kill the Minotaur, the player first has to find a sword and will then kill it automatically upon contact. If not in possession of a sword the player can press the spacebar to quickly run away from the Minotaur. It will however cause all collected items to disappear.",unspecified,unspecified,unspecified
